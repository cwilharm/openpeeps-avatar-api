Create an python FastAPI to build Avatars for profil pictures. It should have endpoints to present the options to choose from and than the user should be able to combine them correctly. You need to add them together to perfect face avatars. Just the faces are relevant with all spezifications. Please note to map it correctly. Answer always with the final result. It should also create a key, which represents the item combination. An Endpoints should also read the key and returns the avatar thats behind this key. You can find the items in the folder @Separate Atoms. Please review them first. Also make sure to use a simple API structure. Also create a random endpoint to create random variant keys. It needs to be simple for later implementation in the frontend.
